h3. Mapped Network Drive Configuration
It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you map your Circe home directory to your S: drive and save all FDTD solution work to it.  This way, it is available on the cluster when you decide its time to run a distributed analysis.  For information on performing this process, see the following guide: [[CirceDataAccess|Accessing Your Data]]

h2. Running FDTD Solutions on the Cluster
Below is an example of how to run FDTD Solutions on Circe using your S: drive and locally-installed FDTD Solutions software.

** From my workstation, I've saved my project to @S:\nanowire\nanowire_1.fsp@
** I then log into Circe via SSH and change my directory to ~/nanowire, which is the same directory that appears on my S: drive: 
   <pre>
[user@host ~]$ cd ~/nanowire
[user@host nanowire]$
</pre>
** To run FDTD Solutions, I submit a job to the scheduler, specifying my project file:
   <pre>
[user@host nanowire]$ run -n 8 -t 1:00:00 -e FSPFILE=nanowire_1.fsp fdtd/7.5.2
</pre>
** I can view the status of my job with the @qstat@ command.  
** Once the simulation is complete, I can open S:\nanowire\nanowire_1.fsp from FDTD Solutions on my workstation to view the results.

For more information on using the @run@ command, see [[Run|The GridEngine Run Utility]].
