== Description == 

Advanced Design System (ADS) is the leading electronic design automation software for RF, microwave, and high speed digital applications. ADS pioneers the most innovative and commercially successful technologies, such as X-parameters and 3D EM simulators, used by leading companies in the wireless communication &amp; networking and aerospace &amp; defense industries. For WiMAXâ„¢, LTE, multi-gigabit per second data links, radar, &amp; satellite applications, ADS provides full, standards-based design and verification with Wireless Libraries and circuit-system-EM co-simulation in an integrated platform.

== Running ADS on the Cluster ==

=== Modules ===

Before running a job, you must first set up your environment properly. Here are the required module files:

 * apps/ads/2009u1

To run ADS on the cluster, ensure that you use `module add` prior to using any ADS executables.  See [wiki:Modules] for more information.

=== Multiprocessor Graphical ADS ===

ADS can be run on Circe either using the run command from a terminal window or through the NX environment using the Applications menu. For more information about the NX environment, please see our [wiki:CirceDesktop "Circe NX Desktop"] documentation.  Below is an example for using the run command.

{{{ 
run -i -n 2 -m 2.0G -t 04:00:00 ads/2009u1
}}}

This will start an interactive 2 processor ADS session with a limit of 2 GB of RAM for 4 hours.  If you have a properly configured X11 session, you should see the full ADS interface.  For users wishing to use the graphical interface over X11 on Windows, please see our [wiki:XWin32Install "XWin32 Installation"] documentation.

=== Using Design Kits ===

To load currently installed design kits, click !DesignKit-&gt;List Design Kits, and enable the ones you would like to use.

To load you own design kits, follow the instructions below.

1. Start ADS and install the design kit:
     a. From the ADS main window, click !DesignKit-&gt;Install Design Kits;
     b. Click Browse (next to Path) and locate the design kit library folder;
     c. The rest of the information will fill in automatically;
     d. Select USER LEVEL;
     e. Click OK and the design kit will be installed.

2. The new library design kit can now be run; the components can be selected from either the component pallet or component library.
