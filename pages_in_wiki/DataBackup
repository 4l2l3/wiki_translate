= Data Backups &amp; File Recovery =
----

All data that resides in `/home`, `/shares`, and `/apps` on Circe is replicated to another server every night.  We maintain 14 days of incremental backups (which means, we can retrieve files going back 2 weeks) on a mirror host.  The backup host is then backed up by an IBM Tivoli Tape Library run by Information Technology.  

All data that resides on `/work` is NOT backed up and is NOT redundant.  It is for temporary staging of data from running jobs.  If you value the data, it should NOT be left on `/work`.

== File Recovery ==

If you need files recovered due to an accidental deletion, you should contact mailto:help@usf.edu.  Please specify the file name, the full path to the file, and how many days ago it would have been available.
