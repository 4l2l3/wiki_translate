h2. Installation

----

h3. IDL Windows Installation

p. Before you begin:

p. There are two installation packages:
p((((. idl82win32_setup.exe for 32-bit Windows systems
p((((. idl82win64_setup.exe for 64-bit Windows systems

p((((. Note: If you have a 64-bit Windows system, use the 64-bit installation package. It includes both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of IDL.

p. You need Administrator privileges to install IDL. If you do not have such privileges, the installation process will fail because it cannot modify the system configuration.

p. Installation Instructions

p. To download and install IDL:

** Get the installer from https://rc.usf.edu/isos/IDL/8.2/.  Log in using your NetID and password. Download the idl82winXX_setup.exe file.

** In the Save As dialog, specify a location to save the executable file you are downloading, and click Save.

** After the download is complete, go to the location where you saved the idl82win32_setup.exe or idl82win64_setup.exe file and double click on it to begin installing IDL.

** Click Setup, and follow the prompts to install IDL.

----

h3. IDL Unix Installation


p. Before you begin:

** Choose a place to install IDL on your system and create that directory. The default installation path is /usr/local/exelis.

** If you need to create the directory, be sure you have root (or similar) permissions, and issue the following commands:

p((((. % mkdir /usr/local/exelis (to create) 
p((((. % chmod a+rx /usr/local/exelis (to give access) 

** Get the installation archive from  https://rc.usf.edu/isos/IDL/8.2/.  Log in using your NetID and password. Download the idl82linux.x86_64.tgz file.

** Log on as root on your machine.

** The installation file is a compressed archive; save it in the directory in which you are installing IDL (/usr/local/exelis by default).
p((((. Unpack the archive by entering:

p((((. % tar xfvz idl82linux.x86_64.tgz

p((((. Execute the installation program by entering the following command:

p((((. % ./install.sh 

** Follow the prompts to install IDL.

p((. -If you choose not to create symbolic links, you can set up IDL by issuing the following command:

p((((. % source install_dir/idl/idl82/bin/idl_setup

p((. where install_dir is the main installation directory. Then run the IDL application.

** Once the installation finishes, you will need to install the license file. Copy the license file you receive by email to "/usr/local/itt/license/license.dat".
p((((. 
p. You should now be able to start @idlde@ (text mode) from the command line.

----

h3. IDL Mac Installation
p. To download and install IDL:

** Get the installation archive from  https://rc.usf.edu/isos/IDL/8.2/.  Log in using your NetID and password. Download the InstallIDL82_Mac.pkg file. Note the location to which you are downloading the PKG file.

** Double-click the file InstallIDL82_Mac.pkg.

** Follow the prompts to install IDL.

----

h2. Running on Circe

p. Running IDL on @circe@, you need to make sure you have X11 Forwarding enabled. If you're logging in from a UNIX/Linux system, you will need to do the following:
p((((((. {{{
ssh -Y user@circe.rc.usf.edu
p((((((. }}}
p((((((. If you're logging in from a Windows machine, you need to Enable X11 Forwarding in whatever ssh client you're using.  Make sure you've followed our [[XWin32Install|XWin32 Guide]] to configure your connection to @circe@.

p. Next, use qlogin to enter an interactive shell. This example is for 4 hours:
{{{
qlogin -l h_rt=04:00:00
}}}
p. Once you get dropped into an interactive shell on the execution host, you need to load the IDL module.
{{{
module load apps/idl/8.2
}}}
p. You should now be able to execute @idlde@ (text mode) from the command line.

p. IDL can also be launched through the NX environment using the Applications menu.  For more information about the NX environment, please see our [[CirceDesktop|Circe NX Desktop]] documentation.

h3. Tutorials

p. More information about the features of IDL can be found by using @idldemo@.  The graphical mode also includes a tutorial.

h3. Reporting Bugs

p. Report bugs directly to Research Computing: support@rc.usf.edu
