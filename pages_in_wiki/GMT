== Description == 

''From http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GMT/:'' GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) is an open source collection of ~60 tools for manipulating geographic and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and producing encapsulated postscript file (EPS) illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots via contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3-D perspective views. GMT supports ~30 map projections and transformations and comes with support data such as GSHHS coastlines, rivers, and political boundaries.

== Version ==

=== Modules ===

Before running a job, you must first set up your environment properly. Here are the required module files:

 * `apps/gmt/4.5.5`

To run GMT on the cluster, ensure that you use `module add` prior to using any GMT executables.  See [wiki:Modules] for more information.

=== Running on Circe ===

Running GMT on `circe` is relatively easy. Before you login to `circe`, you need to make sure you have X11 Forwarding enabled. If you're logging in from a UNIX/Linux system, you will need to do the following:
      {{{
ssh -Y user@circe.rc.usf.edu
      }}}
      If you're logging in from a Windows machine, you need to Enable X11 Forwarding in whatever ssh client you're using.  Make sure you've followed our [wiki:XWin32Install "XWin32 Guide"] to configure your connection to `circe`.

Next, you need to load the GMT module.
{{{
module load apps/gmt/4.5.5
}}}
You should now be able to execute GMT related scripts and executables from the command line.  To view the output postscript files, you can use `evince`.
