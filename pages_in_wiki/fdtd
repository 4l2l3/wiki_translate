=== Mapped Network Drive Configuration ===
It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you map your Circe home directory to your S: drive and save all FDTD solution work to it.  This way, it is available on the cluster when you decide its time to run a distributed analysis.  For information on performing this process, see the following guide: [wiki:CirceDataAccess "Accessing Your Data"]
-----
== Running FDTD Solutions on the Cluster ==
Below is an example of how to run FDTD Solutions on Circe using your S: drive and locally-installed FDTD Solutions software.

 * From my workstation, I've saved my project to `S:\nanowire\nanowire_1.fsp`
 * I then log into Circe via SSH and change my directory to ~/nanowire, which is the same directory that appears on my S: drive: 
   {{{
[user@host ~]$ cd ~/nanowire
[user@host nanowire]$
}}}
 * To run FDTD Solutions, I submit a job to the scheduler, specifying my project file:
   {{{
[user@host nanowire]$ run -n 8 -t 1:00:00 -e FSPFILE=nanowire_1.fsp fdtd/7.5.2
}}}
 * I can view the status of my job with the `qstat` command.  
 * Once the simulation is complete, I can open S:\nanowire\nanowire_1.fsp from FDTD Solutions on my workstation to view the results.

For more information on using the `run` command, see [wiki:Run "The GridEngine Run Utility"].
