== Description == 

''From the Trans-ABySS web site'':  Trans-ABySS is a software pipeline for analyzing ABySS-assembled contigs from shotgun transcriptome data. The pipeline accepts assemblies that were generated across a wide range of k values in order to address variable transcript expression levels. It first filters and merges the multi-k assemblies, generating a much smaller set of nonredundant contigs. It contains scripts that map assembled contigs to known transcripts, currently supporting the Blat contig-to-genome aligner. It identifies novel splicing events like exon-skipping, novel exons, retained introns, novel introns, and alternative splicing. Its scripts can also identify candidate gene-fusions, single-nucleotide variants, insertions, deletions, and inversions.

== Running Trans-ABySS Jobs on the Cluster ==

=== Modules ===

Before running a job, you must first set up your environment properly.  Here are the required module files:

 * apps/trans-abyss/1.4.4

To run Trans-ABySS on the cluster, ensure that you use `module add` prior to using any executables.  See [wiki:Modules] for more information.

=== How to Submit Jobs ===
Make sure to run your job from your $WORK directory. Use the a submit script like the following to run Trans-ABySS:

{{{
#$ -N &lt;job_name&gt;
#$ -l h_rt=HH:MM:SS,pcpus=&lt;#_of_processors&gt;
#$ -cwd
#$ -j y
#$ -o output.$JOB_ID

module purge
module load apps/trans-abyss/1.4.4

python wrappers/trans_abyss.py &lt;arguments&gt; &lt;input_file(s)&gt;
}}}

Your submit scripts will vary depending on your individual needs.

For help on submitting jobs to the queue, see our [wiki:gridEngineUsers "GridEngine User's Guide"].  These scripts are provided as examples only.  Your SGE and ABySS options will vary.  View the user's guide (link and location provided below) for more about Trans-ABySS options.
