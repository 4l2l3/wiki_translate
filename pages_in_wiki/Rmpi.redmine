h1. R and RMPI
----

h2. Description

Rmpi is a package that provides MPI bindings for the R programming language.  In much the same way parallel code is written in other languages such as C or Fortran, R codes can run in parallel across multiple processors or nodes.

h2. Version

** *RMPI 0.5.8*
** *R 2.11.1*

h2. Authorized Users 

** @circe@ account holders

h2. Platforms

** @circe@ cluster

h2. Local Documentation

h3. Modules

Rmpi requires the following module file and some prerequisites to run:
** @apps/R/2.11.1@
** Prerequisites: @compilers/gcc/4.4.2 openmpi/1.4.1-x86_64-gcc-4.4.2@
To run [[Rmpi]] on the cluster, ensure that you use @module initadd@ to make the changes persistent.  See [[Modules]] for more information.

h3. Prepare your R Environment

Copy this file to /path/to/job/directory/.Rprofile to allow [[Rmpi]] jobs to work:
{{{
cp /opt/apps/R/2.11.1/share/Rprofile ~/rmpitest/.Rprofile
}}}

h3. Submitting a Job

The submit script for running [[Rmpi]] jobs on the cluster is fairly simple.  An example script is provided below:

{{{
#!/bin/bash
#$ -N rmpi-test
#$ -cwd
#$ -l h_rt=hh:mm:ss,pcpus=4
#$ -j y
#$ -o output.$JOB_ID

module purge
module add apps/R/2.11.1 compilers/gcc/4.4.2 openmpi/1.4.1-x86_64-gcc-4.4.2
mpirun [[Rmpi]] TestRmpi.R
}}}

You can submit this job in exactly the same way as you would any other application.
