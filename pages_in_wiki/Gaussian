== Description ==
''From http://www.nersc.gov/nusers/resources/software/apps/chemistry/g09/'' Gaussian 09 is a connected series of programs for performing semi-empirical, density functional theory and ab initio molecular orbital calculations. 

== Version ==

 * '''09b01'''

== Authorized Users ==

 * Users authorized by Dr. Venkat Bhethanabotla and added to the `gaussian` group.

== Platform ==

 * `circe` cluster

== Running Gaussian on the Cluster ==

Gaussian is quite easy to execute on Circe.  After creating your input, simply use [wiki:Run `run`] to execute the program:
{{{
[user@host ~]$ run -N test_g09 -n 8 -t 1:00:00 -e MODEL=input.com gaussian/09b01_em64t
}}}

This will request a job with the name test_g09, 8 processors via MPI, and a 1 hour run-time.  The input file is specified as input.com, and will generate an output file in your current directory.
