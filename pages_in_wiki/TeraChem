== Description ==
''From the !TeraChem user guide:'' !TeraChem is general purpose quantum chemistry software designed to run on NVIDIA GPU architectures under a 64-bit Linux operating system.

== Version ==

 * '''1.0'''

== Authorized Users ==

 * Users authorized by Dr. Brian Space and added to the `terachem` group.

=== Running !TeraChem on the Cluster ===

The !TeraChem user guide is essential to understanding the application and making the most of it.  The guide and this page should be all you need to get started with your simulations.
 * /opt/apps/terachem/1.0/TeraChem/userguide.pdf

!TeraChem is quite easy to execute on Circe.  After creating your input, simply use [wiki:Run `run`] to execute the program:
{{{
[user@host ~]$ run -n 8 -N test_name -t 4:00:00 -e CONFIG=config.inp terachem/1.0
}}}

This will request 8 processors, a job name of test_name, a 4 hour run-time, and specify the input file as config.inp.
