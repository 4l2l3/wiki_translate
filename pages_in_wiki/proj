For many of the projection functions the inverse conversion can also be performed.''

=== Modules ===

PROJ.4 requires the following module file to run:
 * `apps/proj/4.7.1`
See [wiki:Modules] for more information.

=== Running Proj.4 on the Cluster ===

The PROJ manual is essential to understanding the application and making the most of it.  The guide and this page should be all you need to get started with your simulations.  There are also man pages for proj, geod, and cs2cs available after the module is loaded.
 * The PROJ user manual and addendums are available in /opt/apps/proj/manual/

For short jobs (&gt; 10 min.), users can run proj directly from the command line.  For longer jobs, please use a qsub script.  For help on submitting jobs to the queue, see our [wiki:gridEngineUsers "GridEngine User's Guide"].  PROJ commands can also be called from within other scripts.
