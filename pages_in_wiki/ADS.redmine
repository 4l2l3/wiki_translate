h3. Modules

p. Before running a job, you must first set up your environment properly. Here are the required module files:

** apps/ads/2009u1

p. To run [[ADS]] on the cluster, ensure that you use @module add@ prior to using any [[ADS]] executables.  See [wiki:Modules] for more information.

h3. Multiprocessor Graphical [[ADS]]

p. [[ADS]] can be run on Circe either using the run command from a terminal window or through the NX environment using the Applications menu. For more information about the NX environment, please see our [[CirceDesktop|Circe NX Desktop]] documentation.  Below is an example for using the run command.

{{{ 
run -i -n 2 -m 2.0G -t 04:00:00 ads/2009u1
}}}

p. This will start an interactive 2 processor [[ADS]] session with a limit of 2 GB of RAM for 4 hours.  If you have a properly configured X11 session, you should see the full [[ADS]] interface.  For users wishing to use the graphical interface over X11 on Windows, please see our [[XWin32Install|XWin32 Installation]] documentation.

h3. Using Design Kits

p. To load currently installed design kits, click !DesignKit-&gt;List Design Kits, and enable the ones you would like to use.

p. To load you own design kits, follow the instructions below.

1. Start [[ADS]] and install the design kit:
p(((((. a. From the [[ADS]] main window, click !DesignKit-&gt;Install Design Kits;
p(((((. b. Click Browse (next to Path) and locate the design kit library folder;
p(((((. c. The rest of the information will fill in automatically;
p(((((. d. Select USER LEVEL;
p(((((. e. Click OK and the design kit will be installed.

2. The new library design kit can now be run; the components can be selected from either the component pallet or component library.
