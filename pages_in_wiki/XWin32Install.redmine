== Description ==
p. X-Win32 is an X11 server written for Microsoft Windows that allows remote graphical applications on UNIX-based systems -- such as Circe, Sunblast, and Sungiant -- to be displayed on a Windows computer.  This application is useful for accessing graphical UNIX systems and replaces [wiki:XmingInstall XMing] as the actively supported X11 server.

*PLEASE NOTE_': Use of X-Win32 is '_HIGHLY DISCOURAGED* for users of Circe due to performance reasons.  We will NOT support the use of X-Win32 on Circe and encourage users to use the NX desktop environment instead.  The documentation for NX is here: [[CirceDesktop]]
