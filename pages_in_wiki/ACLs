File permissions on Circe determine which users can access your files or directories.  
== Overview ==
Generally, it is desired that only YOU should have access to your files.  Given this general requirement, all home directories are set with the following permissions:
{{{
[jdoe@login0 ~]$ ls -ld ~jdoe
drwx--x---+ 4 jdoe usfuser 4096 Mar  1 12:00 /home/j/jdoe
}}}

This says that only user jdoe can access the directory /home/b/brs.  There is also an x under the group field.  This can be safely ignored as it is used by the ACL (Access Control List) system.  By default, each directory has one ACL applied to it:
{{{
[jdoe@login0 ~]$ acltool show ~jdoe
# file: /home/j/jdoe
USER   jdoe      rwx     
user   apache    --x     
GROUP  usfuser   ---     
mask             --x     
other            ---     

}}}

The special user, `apache`, is granted execute permissions on your directory so that if you have a personal web page in ~/public_html, it will be able to access those files.  These permissions ensure that only you and the special `apache` user have access to any part of your home directory.

By default, when you create a file or directory, it will be created with the default permissions where only you can read or write to that file.  

== Sharing Files ==
To share a file that exists in the top-level of your home directory, e.g. `~/.bash_profile`, with another user, you can simply run:
{{{
[jdoe@login0 ~]$ acltool grant user:jane r ~/.bash_profile
}}}
I'd like my friend, jane, to be able to see some neat things I've added to my ~/.bash_profile, so I've shared it with her.  She wont be able to 
{{{
[jane@login0 ~]$ cd ~jdoe
[jane@login0 jdoe]$ ls
ls: .: Permission denied
}}}
see my files, but she will be able to see the file I shared with her:
{{{
[jane@login0 ~]$ cat .bash_profile
...
...
...
}}}

== Sharing Directories ==
For directory trees, the same is true:
{{{
[jdoe@login0 ~]$ acltool grant group:admin rw ~/documents/admin
}}}

I've provided read-write access to the admin group of the ~/documents/admin folder under my home directory.  The admin users will not be able to see files in ~/ or ~/documents, but they will be able to read and write files inside of ~/documents/admin.

== Revoking Access ==
Let's say I no longer want Jane to see my ~/.bash_profile.  I can run the following command to get rid of this access:
{{{
[jdoe@login0 ~]$ acltool revoke user:jane ~/.bash_profile
}}}
If Jane does not have access to any other files or directories in my home directory, I can remove all ACLs leading up to the file, too:
{{{
[jdoe@login0 ~]$ acltool revokeall user:jane ~/.bash_profile
}}}
I'll also revoke all access to the admin group while I'm at it:
{{{
[jdoe@login0 ~]$ acltool revokeall group:admin ~/documents/admin
}}}

== Displaying Current ACLs ==
I'd like to see who has access to my ~/documents directory.  To do this, I can run
{{{
[brs@login0 ~]$ acltool show documents
# file: /home/j/jdoe/documents
USER   jdoe      rwx     
GROUP  usfuser   ---     
other            ---     

# file: /home/j/jdoe
USER   jdoe      rwx     
user   apache    --x          
GROUP  usfuser   ---     
mask             --x     
other            ---     
}}}

I'll give my friend Dan read access to this folder and its files:
{{{
[jdoe@login0 ~]$ acltool grant user:dan r documents
[jdoe@login0 ~]$ acltool show documents/
# file: /home/j/jdoe/documents
USER   jdoe      rwx     
user   dan       r-x     
GROUP  usfuser   ---     
mask             r-x     
other            ---     

# file: /home/j/jdoe
USER   jdoe      rwx     
user   apache    --x     
user   dan       --x          
GROUP  usfuser   ---     
mask             --x     
other            ---     

}}}
You may notice that when the permissions are dumped for directories, there is always at least an 'x' permission.  This is normal.  Without this permission, a user would not be able to change into that directory, which would make sharing the files impossible.

You may also notice that `acltool show` dumps out the permissions of the parent directory as well.  This is important since your parent directories need to provide enough access to the child directories that you are sharing.

== Removing all ACLs from a File or Directory ==
Let's say you want to remove all ACLs from a given file or directory:
{{{
acltool reset ~/.bash_profile
}}}
or
{{{
acltool reset ~/documents
}}}
will remove any and all ACLs from the file ~/.bash_profile and the directory ~/documents and all files inside of ~/documents

== Resetting ACLs to System Defaults ==
Its possible that you may want to remove all ACLs from files and directories under your home directory.  To do this, run
{{{
[jdoe@login0 ~]$ acltool defaults
This will completely remove ALL ACLs on your home directory!!! Do you wish to continue (Y/N)? Y
}}}

== Caveats ==
1. Never grant write access to your home directory itself.  It will break things like SSH and is very insecure.  The following is a big NO-NO
{{{
[jdoe@login0 ~]$ acltool grant user:jane rw ~jdoe
}}}

2. Only add ACLs to files or directories '''within''' your home directory and '''not''' to your home directory itself.  This is a much safer practice and much less prone to error.
