h2. Description

mpiBLAST is a freely available, open-source, parallel implementation of NCBI BLAST. By efficiently utilizing distributed computational resources through database fragmentation, query segmentation, intelligent scheduling, and parallel I/O, mpiBLAST improves NCBI BLAST performance by several orders of magnitude while scaling to hundreds of processors. mpiBLAST is also portable across many different platforms and operating systems. Lastly, a renewed focus and consolidation of the many codebases has positioned mpiBLAST to continue to be of high utility to the bioinformatics community.

** @apps/mpiblast/1.6.0@
See [[Modules]] for more information.

h2. Creating and Submitting a Job

Create a .ncbirc file in your home directory.  It should be formatted as follows (user location of /work directory will vary):

{{{
  [mpiBLAST]
  Shared=/work/j/joeuser/blast
  Local=/tmp/joeuser/blast
}}}

'Shared' is a location that all of the nodes doing the computation will have access to and 'Local' should be a faster, local drive.

h3. Prepare a database for use
Research Computing mirrors several of the available databases.  They can be found in /opt/apps/ncbi-6.1/blast/fasta.  If one of those will serve your needs, simply copy it from that location to your Shared location, and decompress it.

{{{
[joeuser@host ~]$ module add apps/mpiblast/1.6.0
[joeuser@host ~]$ cp /opt/apps/ncbi-6.1/blast/fasta/drosoph.nt.gz /work/j/joeuser/blast
[joeuser@host ~]$ cd /work/j/joeuser/blast
[joeuser@host blast]$ gunzip drosoph.nt.gz
}}}

Then, you need to format the database for use.  Below is an example way to do so.  It assumes you want to run a job searching against the drosoph.nt database, on 4 nodes.

{{{
[joeuser@host blast]$ mpiformatdb --nfrags=4 -i drosoph.nt -pF --quiet
}}}

h3. Submit the Job

Below is a sample job script.  It assumes that you want a hard runtime of 1 hour and that you have set up the database in 4 fragments.  It also assumes that your value being searched for is in a file called query.in, in the current working directory.  You'll need to request two more processors than the number of fragments for the two coordinating processes that are created during execution.

{{{
#!/bin/bash
#$ -N mpiblast-test
#$ -cwd
#$ -l pcpus=6,h_rt=01:00:00
#$ -j y
#$ -o output.$JOB_ID

module add apps/mpiblast/1.6.0
mpirun mpiblast -d drosoph.nt -i query.in -p blastn -o results.txt
}}}

Example query.in file for drosoph.nt:

{{{
&gt;Search sequence
AGTACGTAAAGAAAATCTTTTTTTGGCGACATCATTGTATTTGGTAGTATACGATTTCCAGCATCCACAACTATTTCCT
}}}
