[[PageOutline]]

The following page will describe the system layout with details on where files and directories are stored.

== Hardware ==
=== Circe Login Nodes ===
When a user connects via SSH to `circe.rc.usf.edu`, they will end up on one of several login nodes.   These are the redundant, load-balancing login nodes which will allow you to access your files, develop code, submit jobs, and review your data.

=== Storage ===
==== /home ====
Circe's storage resides on a !FibreChannel SAN which is centrally managed by Information Technology.  2 servers are connected to the SAN fabric to provide fail-over redundancy for data access.  The data for /home is snapshotted nightly to another storage device where up to 14 days of snapshots are kept.  The /home file system is served via NFS to all nodes in the Circe environment.

Home directories are laid out as follows:
{{{
/home/[a-z]/&lt;netid&gt;
}}}
where [a-z] is the first letter of the user's NetID.  `$WORK` or `/work` is laid out identically to `/home`

==== /work ====
`/work` is a high-performance file system served by the Lustre filesystem, built on !DataDirect Networks' !ExaScaler product.  This platform allows us to distribute read and write requests from many hosts to a number of servers to balance load and provide increased throughput and performance.  It is recommended that users utilize this storage space when running their jobs.  Data on `/work` is NOT backed up and files can be removed that have not been accessed within 6 months.

==== /apps ====
`/apps` contains most of the system's third-party applications.

=== Clusters ===
Circe provides access to several compute cluster environments, some of which are accessible University-wide and others which are only accessible by certain research groups.  Please see the [wiki:gridEngineQueue "queue layout"] documentation for more information.
