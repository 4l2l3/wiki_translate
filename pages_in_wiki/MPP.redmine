h2. Description 

_From Agilent:_ Agilent Mass Profiler Professional ([[MPP]]) software is a powerful chemometrics platform designed to exploit the high information content of MS data and can be used in any MS-based differential analysis to determine relationships among two or more sample groups and variables. [[MPP]] provides advanced statistical analysis and visualization tools for GC/MS, LC/MS, CE/MS and ICP-MS data analysis. [[MPP]] also integrates smoothly with Agilent Mass Hunter Workstation, Spectrum Mill and Chem Station software and is the only platform that provides integrated identification/annotation of compounds and integrated pathway analysis for metabolomic and proteomic studies. The system also enables Automated Sample Class Prediction that revolutionizes mass spectrometer-based qualitative analysis of unknown samples in many applications.
