h1. Oases

h2. Description 

_From the Oases home page_: Oases is a _de novo_ transcriptome assembler designed to produce transcripts from short read sequencing technologies, such as Illumina, SOLiD, or 454 in the absence of any genomic assembly.  Oases uploads a preliminary assembly produced by Velvet, and clusters the contigs into small groups, called "loci". It then exploits the paired-end read and long read information, when available, to construct transcript isoforms.

h2. Running Oases Jobs on the Cluster

h3. Modules

Before running a job, you must first set up your environment properly.  Here are the required module files:

** apps/oases/0.1.22

To run Oases on the cluster, ensure that you use @module add@ prior to using any executables.  See [[Modules]] for more information.

h3. How to Submit Jobs

Provided is a batch script for running Oases executables on the cluster.  This script can be copied into your work directory (the folder with your input files and database files) so that you can submit batch processes to the queue.  For help on submitting jobs to the queue, see our [[gridEngineUsers|GridEngine User's Guide]].  This script is provided as an example only.  Your SGE and Oases options will vary.  View the product manual or this site (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oases/Manual.txt) for more about Oases runtime options.

h3. Serial Submit Script
You must first process the reads using Velvet: 
* you must choose a hash length at this stage (cf. the Velvet manual),
* DO NOT set a coverage cutoff, you should set that when running oases, 
* DO NOT set an expected coverage,
* remember to turn on the -read_trkg option when running velvetg. 

You can run Oases on the Velvet working directory after it has been created.  Provide all the information about insert lengths and their standard deviation as possible (identical to Velvet):

<pre>
#$ -N oases_job_name
#$ -l h_rt=hh:mm:ss
#$ -cwd
#$ -j y
#$ -o output.$JOB_ID

module add apps/oases/0.1.22

oases output_directory [options]
</pre>

*Note:*  The k-mer length and categories values have a maximum of 57.  See the Oases Manual or use '--help' for more information about Oases options and syntax.

A colorspace version of the Oases executable is also available as 'oases_de'.  Beware that color- and sequence space are incompatible, hence separate sets of executables.  In other words, don’t try to hash sequence ﬁles with colorspace [[oases]] or vice-versa, under penalty of meaningless results!
