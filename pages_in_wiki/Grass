=== Running GRASS GIS on the Cluster ===

The GRASS documentation is essential to understanding the application and making the most of it.  The guides and this page should be all you need to get started with your simulations.
 * The GRASS user documentation and addendums are available on the GRASS-Wiki: http://grass.osgeo.org/wiki/

Before you login to `circe`, you need to make sure you have X11 Forwarding enabled. If you're logging in from a UNIX/Linux system, you will need to do the following:
      {{{
ssh -Y user@circe.rc.usf.edu
      }}}
      If you're logging in from a Windows machine, you need to Enable X11 Forwarding in whatever ssh client you're using.  Make sure you've followed our [wiki:XWin32Install "XWin32 Guide"] to configure your connection to `circe`.

The GRASS GUI can be called from any login node using the following command:

{{{
[user@login ~]$ grass64
}}}
