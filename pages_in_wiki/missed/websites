=== Create a CIRCE account ===
Before you can begin to add content to your site you need to have a CIRCE/myWeb account. If you login to CIRCE/myWeb using an SCP client, which is discussed below, the account will be created for you automatically.

=== Creating a website ===
There are a number of tutorials online about creating an HTML website by hand. You can find a tutorial using your favorite search engine like [http://www.bing.com/ Bing], [http://www.google.com/ Google], [http://www.ask.com/ Ask.com] and the keywords: html and tutorial.   

If you want to avoid writing raw HTML code by hand you can use a WYSIWYG HTML editor. There are a number of graphical WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) applications, some of the most common ones are Microsoft Word, Dreamweaver, !SeaMonkey, and !OpenOffice. 

=== Connecting to !MyWeb, Uploading, and Editing Your Website ===
Users wanting a !MyWeb website should copy or edit their files into the public_html directory under in their home directory. 

When configuring your SCP client use these settings:

'''Server: ssh.myweb.usf.edu[[BR]]
Username: netid[[BR]]
Password: netid password[[BR]]'''

'''Note''': Users who were migrated from the College of Arts and Science webserver, shell.cas.usf.edu, should copy or edit their HTML files located in the shell_public_html directory in their home directory.

'''Users off campus should have the VPN running''' prior attempting to connect with SCP, see VPN documentation '''[ http://net.usf.edu/vpn/ ] '''

=== Accessing your website ===

Once you have uploaded your site you can view it by entering the following URL, where <netid> is your USF NetID: '''!http://<netid>.myweb.usf.edu'''
