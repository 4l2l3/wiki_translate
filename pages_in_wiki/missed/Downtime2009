Downtime dates are picked in advance for planning purposes.  On these dates, the system will enter maintenance mode and will not be accessible.  Generally, the work required on these dates involves driver or kernel updates, software updates, or other changes that will require all jobs to be halted and restarted.  Downtime periods will generally begin at 9a.m. on the day planned and possibly lead into the following day.  The specific times will be announced to the appropriate mailing lists.  Downtimes will be scheduled around Intersession periods in order to facilitate maximum availability while classes are in session.

All proposed changes are tentative and may be changed as the situation warrants.

All dates can be changed by special request to accommodate scheduling needs.  Contact mailto:support@rc.usf.edu to request rescheduling.
