h1. Infiniband Network Information


[[PageOutline]]
USF provides access to 240 processor cores connected by 4x Single-Data-Rate (SDR) Infiniband and over 1200 processors connected by 4x Double-Data-Rate (DDR) !InfiniBand.

h2. SDR Information

SDR Infiniband has a peak theoretical bandwidth of 10Gbps, minus 20% for protocol overhead.  This provides a peak usable bandwidth of roughly 1GB/s.  Latencies across this fabric are roughly 3 microseconds, point-to-point for smaller message sizes.  The bandwidth and low-latency provided by this fabric is generally ample for most parallel workloads.

h2. DDR Information

DDR Infiniband has a peak theoretical bandwidth of 20Gbps, minus 20% for protocol overhead.  This provides a peak usable bandwidth of roughly 2GB/s.  Latencies across this fabric range from 1.3 to 2 microseconds point-to-point for smaller message sizes.  The bandwidth and low-latency provided is quite ample for most parallel workloads.

h2. Using !InfiniBand

To specify the use of Infiniband by your job, regardless of SDR/DDR capabilities, include the following in your job script:
<pre>
#$ -l i_ib=true
</pre>
This will ensure that your job is placed on nodes in either the SDR or DDR networks.

To specify the use of DDR Infiniband, include the following option instead:
<pre>
#$ -l i_ib_ddr=true
</pre>
and for SDR !InfiniBand:
<pre>
#$ -l i_ib_sdr=true
</pre>
