= Developer Portal =

The Developer Portal will provide valuable resources for building, benchmarking, and developing scientific codes on the system.  This will include tutorials and documentation on the following:

 * Using the various compilers like Intel, Portland Group, GNU Compiler Collection, and Sun Studio
 * Documentation on various tools
 * Debugging parallel applications
 * Performance Profiling and Optimization
 * Introductions to C, C++, Fortran, High-Performance Fortran, and Java
 * Using libraries and API's such as MPI, FFTW, GSL, and Matlab
 * Links to publications on useful computational methods and computer science resources

 * '''Note''': The Developer Portal is very much a work in progress.  More of the items described above will be added in the future.
