The Circe utility `snapshot-restore` is useful in situations where a user accidentally deletes an important file, and would like to restore the file from our backup infrastructure. The best way to understand how to use it is by example:

Suppose the user jdoe is working on his dissertation, and accidentally deletes the file `~jdoe/Dissertation.doc` or `S:\Dissertation.doc`

Instead of panicking, we merely execute snapshot-restore:

{{{
[jdoe@login0 ~]$ snapshot-restore
Welcome to the Circe Backup Restoration Utility!

Here is the range of available snapshots:
Snapshots exist between 2011-04-25 and 2011-05-04
NOTE: You may or may not have existing data on all of these dates!

Please enter a date in YYYY-MM-DD format that you wish to restore from:
}}}

Helpdesk staff can run:
{{{
[staff@login0 ~]$ sudo -u jdoe snapshot-restore
}}}
to restore files for other users.

The user is given a range of dates in which snapshots exist. He types 2011-05-03, since it is the most recent:
{{{
Please enter a date in YYYY-MM-DD format that you wish to restore from: 2011-05-03
You chose 2011-05-03...

Now in File Restore Environment
Restricted Command Set: cd <dir>, exit, ls, restore <file/dir>
backupsh jdoe>
}}}

Now the user can change directories(cd <dir>), do a directory listing(ls), 
and restore a file or directory (restore <file/dir>). We can do an ls to look for the lost Dissertation.doc:

{{{
Restricted Command Set: cd <dir>, exit, ls, restore <file/dir>, orestore <file/dir>
backupsh jdoe> ls
.
..
.bash_history
.bash_logout
.bash_profile
Dissertation.doc
stuff
backupsh jdoe>
}}}

We see that `Dissertation.doc` exists and we restore it:

{{{
backupsh jdoe> restore Dissertation.doc

sent 11447 bytes  received 31 bytes  22956.00 bytes/sec
total size is 11342  speedup is 0.99
}}}

We can exit, and user `jdoe` will find the file in his home directory or `S:` drive, appended with the snapshot date in the filename:

{{{
backupsh jdoe> exit
[jdoe@login0 ~]$ ls Dissertation.doc*
Dissertation.doc-2011-05-03
}}}

The user now has a copy of the lost file from the date it was backed up.
