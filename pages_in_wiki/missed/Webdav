= How do I enable Webdav for my USF myWeb account? =

To enable Webdav on your USF myWeb account, first login to CIRCE using these directions [http://rc.usf.edu/trac/doc/wiki/CirceConnect CirceConnect].Once logged into CIRCE, you will be presented with a prompt like the one below and from here you will run the command: enable-dav.
{{{
[joeuser@host ~]$ enable-dav
}}}

Depending on the size of your home directory it may take a few minutes for the '''enable-dav''' command to complete. Once the command has finished a file called .htpasswd.dav will be placed into your home directory, /dav will be added to your public_html/ directory, inside of the dav directory there will be a file called .htaccess. Now you will be able to upload and download files using the Webdav protocol using a client like BitKinex.

To add users that have a NetID, open ~/public_html/dav/.htaccess and simply list them after your
NetID on the 'Require ldap-user' line.  Separated by space.

To add non-NetID users, use the following command:
{{{
[joeuser@login1 ~]$ htpasswd ~/.htpasswd.dav <username>
}}}
