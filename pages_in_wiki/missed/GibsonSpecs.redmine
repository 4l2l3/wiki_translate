h2. Overview


The MRI Cluster is a supercomputing cluster that was brought online in June of 2008.  It was purchased through a grant provided by the National Science Foundation for the purpose of facilitating general scientific research which requires the use of High-Performance Computing capabilities.  It relies on a high-speed interconnect to facilitate message-passing between compute nodes. File servers are available for large temporary or permanent file storage.
