h2. Description

p. [[[[[[[[[[[[ESPRIT]]]]]]]]]]]] is a computational algorithm that can be used to estimate microbial diversity based on 16S rRNA shotgun sequences. It consists of four modules: (1) removes low-quality reads using various criteria, (2) computes pairwise distances of reads, (3) groups reads into OTUs at different dissimilarity levels, and (4) performs statistical inference to estimate species richness.

h4. Job Considerations
p. In order to submit a [[[[[[[[[[[[ESPRIT]]]]]]]]]]]] job, you will need to have two things:
** an input FASTA file that is pre-trimmed
** the number of pieces the FASTA file should be split into for parallelization

p. The number of pieces you choose determines how many tasks will be submitted to the cluster. The kmer-distance calculation will require ((num_pieces SELECT 2) + num_pieces) tasks, and the Needleman-Wunch calculation will require (num_pieces * num_pieces) tasks. For a FASTA file split into 10 pieces, for example, you will have 55 and 100 tasks, respectively. 

p. It is recommended that you do not split the file into more than 10 pieces, since the grid will have to dispatch a lot of tasks and it will take longer for them to finish since not all of them will be dispatched at the same time.

p. It is also recommended that you run your job from /work to ensure integrity of results. 

h4. Submit the Job
p. Ensure that the [[[[[[[[[[[[ESPRIT]]]]]]]]]]]] module is loaded in the persistent environment:
{{{
[aastaneh@login1 ~]$ module initload

bash initialization file $HOME/.modules loads modules:
p((((((((. null apps/esprit/20090715
}}}

p. Create a directory for the [[[[[[[[[[[[ESPRIT]]]]]]]]]]]] run:
{{{
[aastaneh@login1 ~]$ mkdir $WORK/esprit-job1
}}}

p. Copy your FASTA file into the directory:
{{{
[aastaneh@login1 ~]$ cp data/test.fas $WORK/esprit-job1
}}}

p. Finally, change into the job directory and run esprit_cc with the proper options. Press ENTER again to confirm the parameters.
{{{
[aastaneh@login1 esprit-job1]$ esprit_cc test.fas 5
p. Specified input to be handled in 5 parts.
p. The number of processes for the KMER distance and Needleman-Wunsh calculations are 15 and 25, respectively.
p. Press Enter to continue. Otherwise, press Ctrl+c to exit.
