h2. Running ESPRESSO Jobs on the Cluster

h3. Modules
Before running a job, you must first set up your environment properly.  There are two module file options for version 5.0:
** apps/espresso/5.0
or
** apps/espresso/5.0-r-lda

To run ESPRESSO on the cluster, ensure that you use @module add@ prior to using any executables.  See [[Modules]] for more information.

The '-r-lda' version of Quantum Espresso is nearly identical to the standard version, except that there is a minor change in the code that skips a check. To load this version instead, use 'module add apps/espresso/5.0-r-lda'. To read more, see http://www.democritos.it/pipermail/pw_forum/2008-September/010123.html. 

h3. Distributed Parallel
This script can be copied into your job directory (the folder with your input files and database files) and modified so that you can submit batch processes to the queue.   This script is provided as an example only.  Your SGE and ESPRESSO executables, tools, and options will vary.  View the user's guide (/apps/espresso/5.0/Doc/user_guide.pdf) for more about ESPRESSO options.  For help on submitting jobs to the queue, see our [[gridEngineUsers|GridEngine User's Guide]].
