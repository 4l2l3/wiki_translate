h2. Running Maple on Circe

h3. Modules

Maple requires the following module file and some prerequisites to run:
** @apps/maple/16@
To run Maple on the cluster, ensure that you use 'module add' prior to using any Maple executables.  See [[Modules]] for more information.

h3. Submitting a Job

There are two ways to run Maple on Circe depending on the runtime of your particular job.

h4. Jobs Shorter than 20 Minutes in Length
Simply type <pre> xmaple </pre> at the command line. If you have properly configured an X11 session, you should see the full Maple interface.  If you haven't configured X11, you will be able to use the console interface by running <pre> maple </pre> at the prompt.  For users wishing to use the graphical interface over X11, please see our [[XWin32Install|XWin32 Installation]] documentation.

Maple can also be launched through the NX environment using the Applications menu.  For more information about the NX environment, please see our [[CirceDesktop|Circe NX Desktop]] documentation.

h4. Jobs Longer than 20 Minutes in Length
To run Maple jobs on the Circe cluster, users will need to submit their jobs to the scheduling environment if their jobs take more than 20 minutes to run on a standard PC.

If, for example, you have a Maple script file named test.mpl with all your functions defined in it, you would set up a submit script to use the Maple kernel like this:

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
#$ -cwd
#$ -N maple_test
#$ -l h_rt=00:30:00,mps=1.0G
#$ -j y
#$ -o output.$JOB_ID

module load apps/maple/16
maple &lt; test.mpl&gt; output.txt
</pre>

Maple script files can either be created using a standard text editor or by exporting an existing worksheet from Standard Maple in .mpl format.
