== [[Run]]ning Maple on Circe ==

=== [[Modules]] ===

p. Maple requires the following module file and some prerequisites to run:
*** @apps/maple/16@
p. To run Maple on the cluster, ensure that you use 'module add' prior to using any Maple executables.  See [wiki:[[Modules]]] for more information.

=== Submitting a Job ===

p. T[[here]] are two ways to run Maple on Circe depending on the runtime of your particular job.

==== Jobs Shorter than 20 Minutes in Length (most jobs) ====
p. Simply type @ xmaple @ at the prompt.  For users wishing to use the graphical interface over X11, please see our [[XWin32Install|XWin32 Installation]] documentation.

p. Maple can also be launched through the NX environment using the Applications menu.  For more information about the NX environment, please see our [[CirceDesktop|Circe NX Desktop]] documentation.

==== Jobs Longer than 20 Minutes in Length ====
p. To run Maple jobs on the Circe cluster, users will need to submit their jobs to the scheduling environment if their jobs take more than 20 minutes to run on a standard PC.

p. If, for example, you have a Maple script file named test.mpl with all your functions defined in it, you would set up a submit script to use the Maple kernel like this:

{{{
#!/bin/bash
#$ -cwd
#$ -N maple_test
#$ -l h_rt=00:30:00,mps=1.0G
#$ -j y
#$ -o output.$JOB_ID

module load apps/maple/16
maple &lt; test.mpl&gt; output.txt
}}}

p. Maple script files can either be created using a standard text editor or by exporting an existing worksheet from Standard Maple in .mpl format.

==== Guides ====
p. Use the following links for the Maple User Manual and Programming Guide.  A PDF reader is required.
