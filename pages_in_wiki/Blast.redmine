h1. NCBI BLAST
----

h2. Description

The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) finds regions of local similarity between sequences. The program compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical significance of matches. BLAST can be used to infer functional and evolutionary relationships between sequences as well as help identify members of gene families. 

h2. Note About this Software
We also have [[MPIBlast]] available here: (https://rc.usf.edu/trac/doc/wiki/MPIBlast). We recommend use of this software for high-performance benefits. However, we will still support the serial version for special cases.

h3. Creating and Submitting a Job

Create a .ncbirc file in your home directory.  It should be formatted as follows (user location of /work and /home directories will vary):

{{{
  [NCBI]
  DATA=/home/j/joeuser/data

  [BLAST]
  BLASTDB=/work/j/joeuser/db
}}}

Description of the above directories:
The 'DATA' variable gives the location of the NCBI Data directory containing BLOSUM and PAM scoring matrices, among other things. The scoring matrix files are necessary for any type of protein BLAST search and should be accessible by all cluster nodes.  The 'BLASTDB' variable tells standard NCBI blastall where to find BLAST databases.


h4. Prepare a database for use
Research Computing mirrors several of the available databases.  They can be found in /opt/apps/ncbi-6.1/blast/fasta.  If one of those will serve your needs, simply copy it from that location to your BLASTDB location, and decompress it.

{{{
[joeuser@host ~]$ module add apps/blast/2.2.22
[joeuser@host ~]$ cp /opt/apps/ncbi-6.1/blast/fasta/drosoph.nt.gz /work/j/joeuser/blast
[joeuser@host ~]$ cd /work/j/joeuser/blast
[joeuser@host blast]$ gunzip drosoph.nt.gz
}}}


h4. Submit the Job
Below is a sample job script.  It assumes that you want a hard runtime of 1 hour.  It also assumes that your value being searched for is in a file called query.in, in the current working directory. (For detailed parameters, please look at the BLAST+ documentation: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/2.2.22/user_manual.pdf)

{{{
#!/bin/bash
#$ -l h_rt=01:00:00, pcpus=1
#$ -N blast-text
#$ -cwd
#$ -j y
#$ -o output.$JOB_ID

module add apps/blast/2.2.22
blastp -db drosoph.nt -query query.in -out results.txt
}}}
