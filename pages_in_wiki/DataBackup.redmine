h1. Data Backups

----

All data that resides in @/home@ on Circe is replicated to another server every night.  We maintain 14 days of incremental backups (which means, we can retrieve files going back 2 weeks) on a mirror host.  The backup host is then backed up by an IBM Tivoli Tape Library run by Information Technology.  

All data that resides on @/work@.

h2. File Recovery


If you need files recovered due to an accidental deletion, you should contact help@usf.edu.  Please specify the file name, the full path to the file, and how many days ago it would have been available.
