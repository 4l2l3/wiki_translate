== Description ==

DL_POLY is a parallel molecular dynamics simulation package developed at Daresbury Laboratory by W. Smith and T.R. Forester.

== Version ==

2.19, 3.08

== Authorized Users ==

 * `circe` account holders

== Platforms ==

 * `circe` cluster

== Running DL_POLY on the Cluster ==
The following describes what is necessary to run DL_POLY on the cluster.

=== Modules ===
DL_POLY requires the following module file and some prerequisites to run:
 * `apps/dlpoly/2.19` or  `apps/dlpoly/3.08`
 * Prerequisites: `compilers/pgi/7.0-7.x86_64 openmpi/1.2.6-x86_64-pgi-7.0-7`
To run DL_POLY on the cluster, ensure that you use `module initadd` to make the changes persistent.  See [wiki:Modules] for more information.

=== Job Script ===
To run DL_POLY, you will need to create a work directory for your job that includes the necessary input files (CONFIG, CONTROL, FIELD and possible TABLE or TABEAM).  You'll also need to include a copy of this submit script (modify it to suit your parameters)

{{{
#!/bin/bash
#$ -N dl_poly_job
#$ -l h_rt=00:04:00, pcpus=4
#$ -cwd

mpirun DLPOLY.X-2.19
}}}

Or, for DL_POLY 3.08:

{{{
#!/bin/bash
#$ -N dl_poly_job
#$ -l h_rt=00:04:00, pcpus=4
#$ -cwd

mpirun DLPOLY.Y-3.08
}}}
