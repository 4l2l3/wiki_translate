h2. Running DL
The following describes what is necessary to run DL_POLY on the cluster.

h3. Modules
DL_POLY requires the following module file and some prerequisites to run:
** @apps/dlpoly/2.19@
** Prerequisites: @compilers/pgi/7.0-7.x86_64 openmpi/1.2.6-x86_64-pgi-7.0-7@
To run DL_POLY on the cluster, ensure that you use @module initadd@ to make the changes persistent.  See [[Modules]] for more information.

h3. Job Script
To run DL_POLY, you will need to create a work directory for your job that includes the necessary input files (CONFIG, CONTROL, FIELD and possible TABLE or TABEAM).  You'll also need to include a copy of this submit script (modify it to suit your parameters)

{{{
#!/bin/bash
#$ -N dl_poly_job
#$ -l h_rt=00:04:00, pcpus=4
#$ -cwd

mpirun DLPOLY.X-2.19
}}}

Or, for DL_POLY 3.08:

{{{
#!/bin/bash
#$ -N dl_poly_job
#$ -l h_rt=00:04:00, pcpus=4
#$ -cwd

mpirun DLPOLY.Y-3.08
}}}
