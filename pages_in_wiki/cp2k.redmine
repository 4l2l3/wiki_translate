h2. Description
_From the CP2K home page_: CP2K is a program to perform atomistic and molecular simulations of solid state, liquid, molecular, and biological systems. It provides a general framework for different methods such as e.g., density functional theory (DFT) using a mixed Gaussian and plane waves approach (GPW) and classical pair and many-body potentials.  CP2K is written in Fortran 95 and can be run efficiently in parallel.  However, you'll find all versions of the CP2K code come with little documentation and without any warranty.

h2. Modules

CP2K requires the following module file with prerequisites to run:
** @apps/cp2k/2.3.43@
See [[Modules]] for more information.  

h2. Running CP2K on the Cluster

Please reference the CP2K home page for information on configuring the application inputs for execution.

Once you're ready to execute a job, the following command will submit a job to the cluster:
{{{
[user@host ~]$ run -n 16 -t 01:00:00 -e INPUT=input.inp cp2k/2.3.43
}}}
You can see here that we've specified to use 16 processors for 1 hour.  We've also defined our input file to be @input.inp@.

For more information on Run, see [[Run|The GridEngine Run Utility]].
