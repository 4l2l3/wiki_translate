h2. Description
 

_From http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GMT/:_ GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) is an open source collection of ~60 tools for manipulating geographic and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and producing encapsulated postscript file (EPS) illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots via contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3-D perspective views. GMT supports ~30 map projections and transformations and comes with support data such as GSHHS coastlines, rivers, and political boundaries.

h3. [[Modules]] 

Before running a job, you must first set up your environment properly. Here are the required module files:

** @apps/gmt/4.5.5@

To run GMT on the cluster, ensure that you use @module add@ prior to using any GMT executables.  See [[Modules]] for more information.

h3. Running on Circe


Running GMT on @circe@ is relatively easy. Before you login to @circe@, you need to make sure you have X11 Forwarding enabled. If you're logging in from a UNIX/Linux system, you will need to do the following:
      <pre>
ssh -Y user@circe.rc.usf.edu
      </pre>
      If you're logging in from a Windows machine, you need to Enable X11 Forwarding in whatever ssh client you're using.  Make sure you've followed our [[XWin32Install|XWin32 Guide]] to configure your connection to @circe@.

Next, you need to load the GMT module.
<pre>
module load apps/gmt/4.5.5
</pre>
You should now be able to execute GMT related scripts and executables from the command line.  To view the output postscript files, you can use @evince@.
