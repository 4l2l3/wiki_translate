h2. Description 

_From the Trans-[[ABySS]] web site_:  Trans-[[ABySS]] is a software pipeline for analyzing [[ABySS]]-assembled contigs from shotgun transcriptome data. The pipeline accepts assemblies that were generated across a wide range of k values in order to address variable transcript expression levels. It first filters and merges the multi-k assemblies, generating a much smaller set of nonredundant contigs. It contains scripts that map assembled contigs to known transcripts, currently supporting the Blat contig-to-genome aligner. It identifies novel splicing events like exon-skipping, novel exons, retained introns, novel introns, and alternative splicing. Its scripts can also identify candidate gene-fusions, single-nucleotide variants, insertions, deletions, and inversions.

h3. [[Modules]]

p. Before running a job, you must first set up your environment properly.  Here are the required module files:

** apps/trans-abyss/1.4.4

p. To run Trans-[[ABySS]] on the cluster, ensure that you use @module add@ prior to using any executables.  See [wiki:[[Modules]]] for more information.

h3. How to Submit Jobs
p. Make sure to run your job from your $WORK directory. Use the a submit script like the following to run Trans-[[ABySS]]:

{{{
#$ -N &lt;job_name&gt;
#$ -l h_rt=HH:MM:SS,pcpus=&lt;#_of_processors&gt;
#$ -cwd
#$ -j y
#$ -o output.$JOB_ID

module purge
module load apps/trans-abyss/1.4.4

python wrappers/trans_abyss.py &lt;arguments&gt; &lt;input_file(s)&gt;
}}}

p. Your submit scripts will vary depending on your individual needs.

p. For help on submitting jobs to the queue, see our [[gridEngineUsers|GridEngine User's Guide]].  These scripts are provided as examples only.  Your SGE and [[ABySS]] options will vary.  View the user's guide (link and location provided below) for more about Trans-[[ABySS]] options.
